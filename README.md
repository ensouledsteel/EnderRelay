# Ender Relay

Basically just implementing the concept of the Ender Relay from Kenadian, while adding a few tweaks of my own to fit my
idea of how this kinda stuff should/could work. Mostly a learning project, but its also going to help me get used to
some concepts for my own End Overhaul. Not made with critical/pvp play in mind.
